Political commentary
Toxic - not addressing other peoples points - important to understand their perspective and make sure your perspective is understood and not just to demonize- hard to do on social media

BDS - both sides claiming other side is not acting in good faith- moral high ground - higher standards for ourself/democracies than other countries - todays politics where its ok as long as my side wins

Enlightened centrism
Trans athletes - by weight not gender
